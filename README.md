Calendar+ App
=============

Maintainer:
===========
Sebastian DÃ¶ll

Version Info:
============
1.0.2

Setup Info:
===========
This version of the calendar app is only compatible with upcoming ownCloud Version 8.1 or later!

The old sharees won't work if you export the database shema from an old installation of ownCloud!
You can use *calendarplus* parallel to your current calendar application: it works on its own tables, so you can thoroughly test it without the risk of messing up your existing calendars. If you want to use your old calendar events, you have to export them using a desktop calendar application or the web interface, and import them to *calendarplus.* It won't work to simply export the database from an older installation of ownCloud.


Installation:
=============
Download the zip file and rename folder from calendarplus-master to calendarplus! Upload the app to your apps directory and activate it on the apps settings page!

Import
======
- 1. Method
ICS File per Drag & Drop on the calendar+ app,  import dialog will prompt
- 2. Method

Important:
If the default calendar app is enabled, too, then you have to disable the calendar app for import from the files app!
